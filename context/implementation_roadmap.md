## Testing Strategy

Each phase includes comprehensive testing:

1. **Unit Tests**: Protocol, encryption, and algorithm correctness
2. **Integration Tests**: Component interaction and messaging flow
3. **Cross-Platform Tests**: iOS/Android compatibility
4. **Performance Tests**: Battery usage and network efficiency

## Dependencies and External Requirements

- Flutter SDK (latest stable)
- flutter_blue_plus: ^1.31.7
- cryptography: ^2.7.0
- hive: ^2.2.3
- permission_handler: ^11.2.0

## Risk Assessment

|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Platform BLE incompatibility | High | Medium | Early platform-specific testing |
| Protocol compatibility issues | High | Low | Binary protocol validation tests |
| Battery performance | Medium | Medium | Power mode optimization |
| Cross-platform UX consistency | Medium | Low | Platform-specific UI adaptation |
| WiFi Direct platform limitations | High | High | Graceful fallback to BLE |

## Future Considerations

### Post-1.0 Features

1. **Ultrasonic Communication**: Alternative transport for radio-restricted environments
2. **LoRa Integration**: Long-range communication for rural/disaster scenarios
3. **File Transfer Optimization**: Enhanced large file handling
4. **Improved Group Management**: Advanced channel controls and permissions
5. **Advanced Mesh Routing**: Dynamic route optimization and congestion control

## Conclusion
