# BitChat Flutter - Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This roadmap defines the development phases, milestones, and dependencies for implementing BitChat Flutter based on the current empty Flutter lib structure and analysis of mature iOS (50+ files) and Android (70+ files) reference implementations. The roadmap prioritizes protocol compatibility, security, and core functionality while providing a realistic timeline for delivering a production-ready cross-platform BitChat client.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Flutter Structure
```
bitchat/lib/
├── main.dart                    # Basic Flutter app entry point
