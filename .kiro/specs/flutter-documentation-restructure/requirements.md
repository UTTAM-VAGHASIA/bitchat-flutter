# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for restructuring the BitChat Flutter project documentation to create a comprehensive, professional documentation system that matches the quality and completeness of the Android and iOS reference implementations. 

**Current State Analysis:**
- The Flutter project has substantial technical documentation in the `docs/` folder with 8 detailed specification files
- Root-level documentation includes API standards, maintenance guides, and documentation index
- The `assets/` folder structure exists but is empty (architecture_diagrams, protocol_diagrams, ui_mockups)
- The Flutter `lib/` structure is mostly empty with only basic folder structure and a minimal main.dart
- Missing critical context documentation (project requirements, roadmaps, feature matrices)
- Missing developer workflow and setup documentation
- Missing reference analysis comparing to iOS/Android implementations

The restructured documentation will serve as the foundation for developing a complete Flutter implementation of BitChat that replicates all functionality present in the Android and iOS versions, including Bluetooth mesh networking, end-to-end encryption, channel management, and cross-platform protocol compatibility.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer implementing specific BitChat features, I want detailed implementation guides for each major component, so that I can build features that work correctly and maintain compatibility with other platforms.
