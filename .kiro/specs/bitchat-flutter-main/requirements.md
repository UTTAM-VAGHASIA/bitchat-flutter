# BitChat Flutter - Main App Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for the main BitChat Flutter application that serves as the foundation for a decentralized peer-to-peer messaging system operating over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh networks. The main app provides the core infrastructure, application shell, and coordination between individual features while maintaining 100% binary protocol compatibility with existing iOS and Android BitChat implementations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Application Foundation and Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured Flutter application foundation, so that I can build upon clean architecture principles and maintain code quality throughout development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize with proper dependency injection container
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL follow Clean Architecture layer separation (Presentation → Application → Domain → Infrastructure)
3. WHEN any feature is accessed THEN the system SHALL use consistent state management patterns across all modules
4. IF the application encounters an error THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully with proper error boundaries
5. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL pass all static analysis checks and maintain >80% test coverage

### Requirement 2: Cross-Platform Compatibility and Performance

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work consistently across iOS, Android, and desktop platforms, so that I can use BitChat on any device with optimal performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app runs on iOS THEN the system SHALL support iOS 14.0+ with native platform integrations
2. WHEN the app runs on Android THEN the system SHALL support Android 8.0+ (API 26+) with proper permissions
3. WHEN the app runs on desktop THEN the system SHALL support Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms
4. WHEN the app is running THEN the system SHALL consume <5% battery per hour in background mode
5. WHEN platform-specific features are needed THEN the system SHALL abstract them through consistent interfaces

### Requirement 3: Application Shell and Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive and responsive app interface, so that I can easily navigate between different features and maintain context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL display a Material Design 3 compliant interface
2. WHEN navigating between screens THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth transitions and preserve state
3. WHEN the app is used THEN the system SHALL support both light and dark themes with system preference detection
4. WHEN accessing features THEN the system SHALL provide consistent navigation patterns across all modules
5. WHEN the app is minimized THEN the system SHALL maintain background connectivity and message processing

### Requirement 4: Feature Integration and Coordination

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modular system that coordinates between features, so that individual features can be developed independently while working together seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN features communicate THEN the system SHALL use well-defined interfaces and event-driven architecture
2. WHEN a feature is updated THEN the system SHALL not break other features due to loose coupling
3. WHEN features share data THEN the system SHALL provide consistent data access patterns
4. WHEN features need coordination THEN the system SHALL use a centralized event bus or mediator pattern
5. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL integrate them without modifying existing feature code

### Requirement 5: Configuration and Settings Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure app settings and preferences, so that I can customize the app behavior to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access settings THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive settings interface
2. WHEN I change settings THEN the system SHALL persist them locally and apply them immediately
3. WHEN settings affect features THEN the system SHALL notify relevant features of changes
4. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL load and apply saved settings
5. WHEN I reset settings THEN the system SHALL restore default values and clear user preferences

### Requirement 6: Logging and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a developer and user, I want comprehensive logging and diagnostic capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor app performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app runs THEN the system SHALL log important events with appropriate log levels
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information including stack traces
3. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging for development
4. WHEN in production THEN the system SHALL limit logging to essential information only
5. WHEN diagnostics are needed THEN the system SHALL provide tools to export logs and system information

### Requirement 7: Security and Privacy Foundation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to maintain strong security and privacy practices, so that my communications remain private and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app handles sensitive data THEN the system SHALL ensure secure memory management and cleanup
2. WHEN the app stores data THEN the system SHALL use appropriate encryption for persistent storage
3. WHEN the app accesses system resources THEN the system SHALL request minimal necessary permissions
4. WHEN security events occur THEN the system SHALL log them appropriately without exposing sensitive information
5. WHEN the app is compromised THEN the system SHALL provide emergency data wipe capabilities

### Requirement 8: Testing and Quality Assurance Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing infrastructure, so that I can ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL support unit testing for all business logic
2. WHEN features are integrated THEN the system SHALL support integration testing between components
3. WHEN the app is built THEN the system SHALL run automated tests in CI/CD pipeline
4. WHEN UI is developed THEN the system SHALL support widget testing for UI components
5. WHEN the app is released THEN the system SHALL have >80% test coverage across all layers

### Requirement 9: Performance Monitoring and Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to perform efficiently and responsively, so that I have a smooth user experience without device performance impact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL launch within 3 seconds on target devices
2. WHEN navigating the app THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps UI performance
3. WHEN processing messages THEN the system SHALL handle operations without blocking the UI thread
4. WHEN memory is used THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage memory allocation and cleanup
5. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide monitoring and profiling capabilities

### Requirement 10: Development and Build Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient development and build processes, so that I can iterate quickly and deploy reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing THEN the system SHALL support hot reload for rapid iteration
2. WHEN building THEN the system SHALL generate optimized builds for all target platforms
3. WHEN code changes THEN the system SHALL run automated quality checks and tests
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL provide consistent build artifacts across environments
5. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive debugging tools and information
